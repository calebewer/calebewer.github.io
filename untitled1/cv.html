Family Life

<h2>
What it's like living with a big family.
</h2>
<p>I have four younger brothers, and two dogs. Living with a lot of people means learning to share, sometimes I like the dogs more than my brothers.</p>
<p>My parents both work in the medical field. My father is a pharmasist and my mother is a nurse practitioner.</p>
